    <!-- PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY -->
    <section id="summary" class="card-section">
      <h2>Professional Summary & Career Narrative</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Royal College–certified pediatrician and fellowship-trained in pediatric
        gastroenterology with a background in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), eosinophilic
        gastrointestinal disorders, pediatric motility and functional testing, and complex nutrition,
        including enteral and parenteral support. Over the course of my career, I have managed a broad
        spectrum of gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary disorders in infants, children, and adolescents,
        while maintaining active involvement in general and emergency pediatrics in tertiary,
        regional, and military healthcare settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        My subspecialty practice has been anchored in comprehensive, evidence-based pediatric
        gastroenterology. This includes advanced diagnostic and interventional endoscopy (upper and
        lower), PEG and PEC insertion, management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding,
        complex constipation and fecal incontinence, celiac disease, very early onset IBD, intestinal
        lymphangiectasia, and post–liver transplant and pancreatitis care. I also have experience with
        capsule endoscopy, pH–impedance monitoring, hydrogen/methane breath testing, and anorectal
        manometry, allowing integration of motility and functional testing into day-to-day clinical
        decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        A major focus of my work has been the interface between gastrointestinal disease, nutrition,
        and neurodevelopment. I have developed particular interest and experience in feeding
        problems, selective and restrictive eating, obesity and metabolic risk, and gastrointestinal
        manifestations of Autism Spectrum Disorder and other neurodevelopmental conditions. I aim to
        deliver care that is technically and diagnostically sound, family-centered, and
        trauma-informed, recognizing the impact of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms on growth,
        development, schooling, and quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teaching and systems-level work are central to my professional identity. I have been actively
        involved in designing and delivering structured education for pediatric residents and fellows,
        supervising case forums and journal clubs, leading board-oriented teaching sessions, and
        developing innovative formats such as podcast-based case learning. I have also led and
        supervised quality-improvement and research projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bring a strong and well-rounded background in pediatrics and pediatric gastroenterology,
        with board certification in Pediatrics by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of
        Canada and LMCC (Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada) certification. My training and
        practice experiences across Canada, the Gulf region, and Iraq, together with earlier work in
        military and academic environments in Texas, have shaped a practice style that is
        collaborative, evidence-based, and highly responsive to the needs of children with complex
        gastrointestinal and nutritional disorders and their families.
